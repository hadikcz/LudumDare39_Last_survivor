# About game:
My third LD entry. Your task is simple, survive as long as possible. But environment in this game is'nt much friendly. You must eat for hinder hunger, heat yourself for prevent freeze in cold night, and lastly defend yourself before zombies, who are wake up at night. Peace time (day) is limited, every day you must prepare for night, make some supplies for next deadly night.


# How to play ?

- 1) You must watch your stats (power), if your heat or hunger go under 0, you will start dying.
- 2) Day have 2 minutes, and every night (60 seconds), will come zombies in wave, there are also cold so you need warm with campfire and fight with zombies.
- 3) For better weapons and tools you must mine stone and wood
- 4) For decrease hunger, you need pick food from bushes and eat it
- 5) Every tool and weapon can be upgraded, but you can carry only one so you must switch between them by click on specific item (not just buy it)

# Controlls
* Movement: [W][A][S][D] or arrow keys
* Attack/mine: [SPACE_BAR]
* Eat: Hit eat button
